Dear Field Gibson Media Team,

My name is Timur Vagizov, and I represent EASTGATE ADVISORY SERVICES - FZCO, =
Dubai UAE. I am interested in integrating a bond/suk=C5=ABk data feed into ou=
r Python-based analytics and dashboard system.

Below are my requirements:
- Instruments (ISINs):
  XS3065329446, XS2633136234, XS2914525154, XS2841181972, XS3068594129, XS277=
7443768
- Fields required: price quotes, yield to maturity, outstanding amount (if av=
ailable), issue date, maturity date
- Frequency: At least end-of-day data, preferably updated daily
- Historical depth: As far back as the series covers (ideally from issuance)
- Delivery format: REST API (JSON/CSV) preferable, or another format you supp=
ort
- Usage: The data will be used internally for analysis and dashboarding by ou=
r team

Could you please provide the following information:
1. Confirmation of coverage: Are the ISINs above included in your database? I=
f yes, which fields are available for each?
2. Frequency and latency of updates: How soon after market close / issuer pub=
lication do prices/yields become available?
3. Pricing tiers: What is the cost structure (monthly, annual, per-instrument=
, minimal tier) for usage at our scale (=E2=89=886 instruments)?
4. Delivery details: Which endpoints/formats are supported, limits on request=
s, any integration support or sample data you provide?

I would appreciate any sample data or sandbox access to evaluate compatibilit=
y before committing.

Thank you very much for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Timur Vagizov
